*We propose the APAP to balance the two competing interests in energy-constrained WSNs.  
APAP mainly consists of two parts: **adaptive packet-reproduction routing and active packet-loss mechanism**.* <br />

• Folder APAP implements our new protocol for data collection;PR and GRDR are the comparison protocol in the cited article.<br />

• Energy consumption at MAC is not considered in our sinmulation.<br />

• The main.m in each file is the entry of program .<br />

• The Test1~4.m in APAP file is the test file for the key parameters.<br />

• Folder "Data statistics code(part)" contains the statistical and plotting codes.<br />

• Before running the simulation protocol, please set the workspace to the corresponding file directory.<br />

• If you run the program on a personal computer, in the following files, you may need to change the path to make it process correctly:<br />
topology.m <br />
write_txt.m <br />
plot_node.m <br />
write_2.m <br />
